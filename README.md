<h1>1. Vision Statement</h1>
This project is for the patients who go to a pharmacy to purchase their medicine. As we may encounter, from time to time patients may not obtain the medicine, because pharmacies has not that specific medicine in their stocks. Therefore, with this application pharmacists will be able to add and update their stocks from a mobile application, so that patients will be able to see the current medicine of the pharmacies from a mobile application. Furthermore in the project, map support will be provided, in order to show the particular pharmacy where patient will go. </br>
Our goal is to provide mobility by an application that shows whichever pharmacy has which medicines , for the patients who needs to purchase a medicine .So that they do not need to look for a pharmacy, if they currently in , does not have that medicine.
<h1>2. Major Features</h1>
For pharmacists, we have login and registration pages. These pages work functionally. The pharmacist can view the profile page after logging in, but normal users will not see this menu. After logging in, the pharmacist can enter the edit screen on the profile page and automatically capture his location via GPS and save it to the system. Pharmacist can also edit working hours and days from this screen. On the medicines page, the pharmacist will see the add medicine button, so s/he will be directed to another page to add a medicine. On the add medicines page, s/he can enter the information and stock number of the medicine s/he wants to add. A normal user will not see the add medicine button and will see a list of medicines available in all pharmacies. In addition, users and pharmacists can use the medicine search to search specific medicine. When the user clicks on the medicine for which s/he wants to see the information, s/he can be directed to the map and view the pharmacies where the medicine is available and open. By clicking on the pins on the map, s/he will see the name of the pharmacy. With the Get directions option on our map, s/he will see the directions of that pharmacy. Pharmacists can delete the drugs they add in the medicines section by swiping to the right, or by pressing the update button when swiping left, they are directed to the medicine update page. Here pharmacist can update the necessary information. On our homepage, there are banners for promotional purposes and promotional photos of the application. At the bottom of the main page, pharmacies registered to the system appear. By clicking on these pharmacies, users can be directed to the pharmacy page and view the pharmacy information and the pharmacist they have.
